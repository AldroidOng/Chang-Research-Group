    "subtitle": "The FUSE (Ferroelectric and Semiconductor Energy) lab studies the fabrication and characterization of advanced ferroelectric and wide bandgap semiconductor materials. The key materials are Gallium Nitride (GaN), Gallium Oxide (Ga₂O₃), Aluminium Scandium Nitride (AlScN), and High-entropy Bismuth Ferrite (BiFeO₃). Our core tools include sputtering and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) systems, which enable us to develop high-quality thin films.\nThrough systematic analysis and innovative fabrication techniques, FUSE lab aims to unlock the potential of ferroelectric and semiconductor heterostructures for energy storage, high-power electronics, and integrated device applications. Our goal is to contribute to cutting-edge technologies that shape the future of sustainable energy and next-generation electronic systems.",
